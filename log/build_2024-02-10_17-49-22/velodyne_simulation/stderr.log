[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvelodyne_control_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "velodyne_control_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "velodyne_control_msgs" with any of the following names:

    velodyne_control_msgsConfig.cmake
    velodyne_control_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "velodyne_control_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "velodyne_control_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "velodyne_control_msgs" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
